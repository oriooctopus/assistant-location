# Adding a micro app (tab)

Read this before writing any code. The app is a shell; each tab is an
independent **module** under `Modules/`. Several sessions can add tabs at the
same time because a module shares **no file** with any other module.

## The contract

`Modules/GLModule.h`:

```objc
@protocol GLModule <NSObject>
+ (NSString *)moduleTitle;        // tab bar title
+ (UIImage *)moduleIcon;          // e.g. [UIImage systemImageNamed:@"calendar"]
+ (NSInteger)moduleOrder;         // lower sorts left; ties break on class name
+ (UIViewController *)makeViewController;   // fresh root VC for the tab
@end
```

Your module class must also register itself at load time:

```objc
+ (void)load {
    [GLModuleRegistry registerModule:self];
}
```

**Forgetting this is silent** — the module simply never appears as a tab, and
nothing fails until CI's `installed N tabs` log-line assertion catches the
missing name (see "CI and verification" below). `GLModuleRegistry` no longer
scans for conformers; it only sorts whatever registered itself. Copy the
snippet above into your module's own `.m` file exactly — it also needs
`#import "GLModuleRegistry.h"`.

`GLModuleRegistry` collects everything that calls `+registerModule:`, sorts
the conformers by `+moduleOrder` then class name, calls `+makeViewController`
on each, and sets `title` / `tabBarItem` / `restorationIdentifier` on the
result. **Do not set your own `tabBarItem`** — the registry owns it.

(Runtime discovery via `objc_copyClassList` + `class_conformsToProtocol` was
the original approach, replaced because it realizes every class in the
process — UIKit, Foundation, everything — just to test each one, which
measured as the single largest phase of cold launch. Self-registration touches
only the classes that actually are modules.)

Orders in use: Todos 50, Growth 100, Finances 150, Football 200, AutoJournal
(Journal) 250, Tracker 400, Settings 500, Upload 600, Events 650. Pick an
unused value; `new_module.sh` defaults to highest + 100. iOS shows only
the first 4 tabs by order plus a "More" bucket for the rest, so today's
visible tab bar is Todos | Growth | Finances | Football, with Journal,
Tracker, Settings, Upload and Events (last, for easiest thumb reach) behind
More.

### Optional hooks: fan-out from the app shell

The app shell (`AppDelegate.m` / `SceneDelegate.m`) contains **zero**
feature-specific knowledge — it doesn't import `GLManager.h`, `CoreLocation`,
or any module header, and it doesn't know what any URL scheme, quick-action
type, or `NSUserActivity` type means. Instead it fans out generically to
every module via five `@optional` methods on `GLModule`:

```objc
+ (void)moduleDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(nullable NSDictionary *)launchOptions;  // app launch, once
+ (BOOL)moduleHandleURL:(NSURL *)url;                                // return YES if consumed
+ (BOOL)moduleHandleUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)activity;         // return YES if consumed
+ (BOOL)moduleHandleShortcutItem:(UIApplicationShortcutItem *)item;  // return YES if consumed
+ (NSString *)moduleDiagnosticSummary;                               // lines for the launch diagnostic alert, or nil
```

`moduleDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` receives UIKit's real launch-options
dictionary unmodified — the shell attaches no meaning to any key in it
(including `UIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocationKey`, a background-location
relaunch signal only a location module cares about). Likewise
`moduleHandleUserActivity:` and `moduleHandleShortcutItem:` receive the real
`NSUserActivity` / `UIApplicationShortcutItem` UIKit handed the shell — never
a synthetic stand-in constructed by the shell to signal something else.
**A module MUST return `NO` from `moduleHandleUserActivity:` and
`moduleHandleShortcutItem:` for any activity/item type it does not own**, so
the registry can offer it to the next module; returning `YES` (or mutating
shared state) for an unrecognized type is a bug, not permissive handling.

`GLModuleRegistry` exposes the matching fan-out, walking the same
`+moduleClasses` list tab installation uses (cached via `dispatch_once` since
module membership can't change at runtime), and guarding every call with
`respondsToSelector:` since the hooks are optional:

```objc
+ (void)notifyModulesDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(nullable NSDictionary *)launchOptions;
+ (BOOL)routeURL:(NSURL *)url;                 // first module returning YES wins
+ (BOOL)routeUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)activity;
+ (BOOL)routeShortcutItem:(UIApplicationShortcutItem *)item;
+ (NSString *)diagnosticSummary;               // joins each module's summary, skipping nil/empty
```

The launch fan-out logs which modules responded (`Module registry: launch
hooks fired for N modules: ...`), the same way tab installation logs which
tabs it installed — `sim-test.yml` asserts on both lines, so a hook renamed
out from under `respondsToSelector:` fails CI instead of silently going dead.

If your module needs to run setup at launch, handle a custom-scheme URL, a
Siri/Handoff continuation, or a home-screen quick action, or contribute a
line to the build diagnostic, implement the relevant method(s) — don't touch
the shell. For lifecycle events that already have a real UIKit notification
(foreground/background/resign-active/terminate), observe the notification
yourself from inside your module rather than asking the shell to call you —
see `Modules/Tracker/TrackerAppLifecycle.m`'s `+load` for the pattern.

## Where files go

```
Modules/<Name>/          ← yours, exclusively. Nothing else may live here.
Modules/GLModule.h       ← the contract (do not edit)
Modules/GLModuleRegistry.{h,m}  ← discovery (do not edit)
Shared/, App/, Location/ ← shared code: the platform layer, BakedConfig, and
                           the location library (see below). You may IMPORT
                           these; do not restructure them.
```

`Modules/` is a **file-system-synchronized folder** (`objectVersion = 77`,
`PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`). Every `.m` you drop under it is compiled
automatically — **there is no `project.pbxproj` edit**, which is why concurrent
branches merge cleanly.

`HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` covers `Modules/`, `App/`, `Location/` and `Shared/`, so
import by bare name: `#import "GLManager.h"`, `#import "GLDropUploader.h"`,
`#import "BakedConfig.h"`.

## The shared platform layer (`Shared/`)

Every tab should look and behave like the same app. Before hand-rolling a
button, a colour, a font size, a failure message, or a launch/background
hook, check whether `Shared/` already has it — it exists specifically because
each of these was previously built two-to-four times, differently, per module.

- **`GLTheme.h`** — appearance mode (`+currentMode`/`+setCurrentMode:`,
  System/Light/Dark, persisted, applies `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` to every
  scene and posts `GLThemeDidChangeNotification`) plus colour tokens
  (`+backgroundColor`, `+surfaceColor`, `+accentColor`, `+destructiveColor`,
  `+textPrimaryColor`, `+textSecondaryColor`), type tokens built on
  `preferredFontForTextStyle:` (`+titleFont`, `+bodyFont`, `+captionFont`,
  `+monoDigitFont`, `+buttonFont`), and metric tokens: a spacing scale
  (`+spacingXXS` through `+spacingXL`), one `+cornerRadius`, one
  `+controlHeight`. Never hardcode a colour, font size, radius or height —
  use these instead.
- **`GLWebModuleViewController.h`** — base class for a tab that's a thin
  wrapper around a web app, three flavors: a locally-hosted server (Events,
  Todos — `-initWithURL:displayName:`), a page bundled straight into the app
  with no update path (`-initWithBundledPageNamed:`), or a **managed** page
  (More, Settings, Journal's Recent screen —
  `-initWithManagedPageNamed:`) — see "Web pages: bundle floor + server
  updates" below. Provides WKWebView setup, pull-to-refresh, a loading
  indicator, an error view with retry, and theme propagation into the page
  (`?theme=light|dark` query param + `data-theme` on `documentElement`, kept
  in sync via `GLThemeDidChangeNotification`).
- **`GLComponents.h`** — `+primaryButtonWithTitle:`, `+statusLabel`,
  `+emptyStateViewWithMessage:`, `+failureViewWithMessage:retryHandler:`,
  `+showToastInView:message:`. One way to build each, all reading `GLTheme`
  tokens.
- **`GLHaptics.h`** — `GLHapticSuccess()`, `GLHapticWarning()`,
  `GLHapticSelection()`. Use these instead of hand-rolling a feedback
  generator per call site.
- **`GLLog.h`** — `GLLog(format, ...)`, prefixes the log line with the
  calling class name (`[EventsViewController] uploaded %@`). Use it instead
  of a bare `NSLog`.
- **`GLFormat.h`** — `GLFormatDuration(seconds)` ("mm:ss" below an hour,
  "h:mm:ss" at or past one) and `GLFilenameTimestamp()`
  ("yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss"). The correct, single implementation — don't write
  your own duration formatter.
- **`GLDefaultsKeys.h`** — centralizes cross-module `NSUserDefaults` key
  constants that don't belong to one module. Add a raw string literal here
  instead of hardcoding it at the call site.

### Optional lifecycle hooks

Beyond the five hooks in the contract above, `GLModule` also declares three
`@optional` UIKit lifecycle hooks, fanned out by `GLModuleRegistry` from a
single observed `UIScene` notification each (in `+moduleOrder`-then-class-name
order, same as everything else):

```objc
+ (void)moduleDidEnterBackground;     // mirrors UISceneDidEnterBackgroundNotification
+ (void)moduleWillEnterForeground;    // mirrors UISceneWillEnterForegroundNotification
+ (void)moduleWillResignActive;       // mirrors UISceneWillDeactivateNotification
```

Implement whichever your module needs instead of hand-rolling your own
`+load` notification observer (the old pattern, still present in
`TrackerAppLifecycle.m` for reference, but not one a new module should copy).

### The default tab

```objc
+ (BOOL)moduleIsDefaultTab;    // return YES to make this the tab the app opens on
```

`GLModuleRegistry` walks `+moduleClasses` in the same order as everything
else and selects the FIRST module that returns `YES` here
(`+selectDefaultTabInTabBarController:`) — at most one module should
implement this returning `YES`. `SceneDelegate` calls it on a cold launch
and again on a foreground resume once the app has been backgrounded past a
threshold (`UITEST_RESUME_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`, default 180s); a quick
app-switch below that threshold leaves the current tab alone. Growth is the
only module that opts in today.

## Web pages: bundle floor + server updates

More, Settings, and Journal's Recent screen (`Modules/WebPages/{more,settings,
recents}.html` + shared `page.css`/`gl-bridge.js`) are **managed pages**,
loaded via `-[GLWebModuleViewController initWithManagedPageNamed:]`. Every
managed page ships in the app bundle exactly like a plain bundled page — the
bundle is the offline floor and always renders, even with no network ever —
but `GLWebPageCache` (`Shared/GLWebPageCache.h`) ALSO checks in the
background, on every open, for a newer verified copy published by
`events/server.py`'s `GET /webpages/manifest.json` + `GET /webpages/files/<name>`
routes, and swaps it in for the next open if one exists. This is what lets a
plain CSS/copy tweak to one of these pages reach the phone through the
normal ~2-minute `assistant` deploy instead of a full OTA rebuild.

**Single source of truth**: `Overland-iOS/Modules/WebPages/`. `events/server.py`
does NOT publish a second, committed copy of these files anywhere — it reads
them straight off disk from the nested Overland-iOS checkout on the same box
(kept at `origin/main` by `deploy/assistant-deploy`'s own Overland-iOS pull,
piggybacked on its normal 2-minute tick) and computes the manifest's hashes
live, on every request. There is nothing here that can drift, by
construction — see `events/test_webpages_route.py`'s drift-check tests,
which prove the served bytes and the manifest's claimed hash both match the
real file on disk.

**Adding a page** needs no new plumbing on either side: drop a new `.html`
into `Modules/WebPages/` (referencing `gl-bridge.js`/`page.css` as sibling
files the way the existing three do), reference it from your module with
`initWithManagedPageNamed:@"yourpage.html"`, done — the server's manifest
route walks the directory, so a new file is served automatically, and the
whole `WebPages/` directory updates as ONE atomic set (page.css/gl-bridge.js
are shared, so a new page's HTML and the shared CSS/JS are never split
across an update).

**Never** hand-edit `location-server/public/` to add a page-serving route —
that directory no longer exists; the pattern above (read live from the
nested Overland-iOS checkout) is the one mechanism, and location-server's own
`GET /recents.html` static route (kept for headless testing) reads from the
same directory rather than a second copy, for the same drift-free reason.

## The location library (`Location/`)

`GLManager`, `LOLDatabase`, `NSArray+map` and `WifiZoneViewController` live in
`Location/` as a **library, not a module** — it has no tab of its own and no
`GLModule` conformer. `Modules/Tracker` and `Modules/Settings` both import it
(`#import "GLManager.h"`) without violating the no-cross-module-imports rule,
because it isn't another module.

### Rules

- **Never** forget the `+load` self-registration snippet above — a module
  that conforms to `GLModule` but never calls `+registerModule:` compiles
  fine and simply has no tab, with no error anywhere.
- **Never** edit `Location/Base.lproj/Location.storyboard` or
  `App/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard`. Build your UI in code.
- **Never** edit another module's directory, `GLModuleRegistry.{h,m}`,
  `GLModule.h`, `AppDelegate.m`, `SceneDelegate.m`, or
  `Overland.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`. These five are the shared contract
  and the shell — a module session touching them can break every other
  module or race a concurrent session editing the same file. Everything an
  ordinary module needs is reachable through the optional-hook fan-out above
  (implement `+moduleDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` / `+moduleHandleURL:` /
  `+moduleHandleUserActivity:` / `+moduleHandleShortcutItem:` /
  `+moduleDiagnosticSummary` in your own module class, or observe a UIKit
  notification yourself) — that is the
  extension point, not editing the shell. A session that finds it genuinely
  needs a new shell hook should propose extending `GLModule.h` /
  `GLModuleRegistry` explicitly, the way this one did, rather than reaching
  into `AppDelegate.m` / `SceneDelegate.m` directly.
- **Never** import another module's headers. Modules depend on `Shared/`,
  `App/` and `Location/` only, never on each other.
- No defensive fallbacks. If a shared invariant is violated, raise.

## Worktree convention

```bash
cd ~/coding/assistant/Overland-iOS
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<module-name> -b <module-name> main
```

One worktree per module, always branched off `main`.

## Scaffolding

```bash
scripts/new_module.sh Events          # → Modules/Events/, order = highest+100
scripts/new_module.sh Events 500      # explicit order
```

Produces a compiling app with a new tab showing a centred label. `git status`
after running it shows **only** `Modules/Events/`.

## CI budget

macOS GitHub Actions runners bill at **10x** normal minutes. The free tier is
~200 macOS minutes/month — that's it, no more.

- `ota` is the default delivery path. It runs automatically on every push to
  `main`, builds an ad-hoc ipa, and a poller on the dev box installs it
  (~1 min, no ASC processing). Don't add anything else to its auto-trigger.
- `build` (TestFlight) is **manual only** (`workflow_dispatch`). Dispatch it
  by hand only when the phone is off the tailnet and OTA can't reach it.
- `sim-test` is **manual only**. It is opt-in — dispatch it when there is an
  actual visual/behavioral claim to verify, not reflexively. Batch: one run
  per change, never one run per question.
- `gen-project` and `device-farm-build` are already manual-only; keep them
  that way.
- Agents must not use CI as a compiler. Don't push or dispatch a workflow to
  "see if it builds" — read the code, use `xcodebuild` locally if available,
  or ask.
- Before dispatching any workflow, run `gh run list` and check for an
  in-flight run of the same workflow first. Don't queue a duplicate.
- Every workflow carries a `concurrency` group keyed on
  `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: true`,
  so rapid successive pushes cancel the stale run instead of stacking minutes.
  Don't remove it.
- `ota.yml`'s `paths-ignore` keeps doc/tooling-only changes from triggering a
  macOS build. When adding a new ignored path, confirm it truly can't affect
  the built product — when in doubt, don't ignore it.

## CI and verification

```bash
gh workflow run sim-test --ref <branch>              # build + boot in simulator
gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1              # poll to completion
gh run download <run-id> -n main-screen -D /tmp/shots
```

`sim-test` builds for the simulator, boots the app, drives location, and
screenshots each tab. Select a tab with `SIMCTL_CHILD_UITEST_TAB=<index>`
(read by `SceneDelegate`). **Add a screenshot step for your tab's index** in
`.github/workflows/sim-test.yml` — that file is the one shared file a module
session may touch, and only to append its own screenshot + artifact path.

Verification means **looking at the pixels** in the downloaded PNGs: your tab
renders its content, and the tab bar shows every module's title in order. A
green run alone is not verification.

The run also asserts on the registry's launch log lines:

```
Module registry: installed N tabs: Tracker, Settings, Upload
Module registry: launch hooks fired for N modules: Tracker
```

Bump `N` and the title list for the tabs line when your tab is added; bump
the launch-hooks line only if your module implements
`moduleDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`.

## Getting a build onto the phone

Pushing to `main` triggers exactly one workflow:

- **`ota`** — ad-hoc ipa, published to the tailnet-only OTA install page
  (URL kept out of this public repo — ask whoever owns the deployment).
  Reaches the phone within ~2 minutes of the push. This is the default
  delivery path.

**`build`** (signed archive → TestFlight) is `workflow_dispatch`-only. Dispatch
it by hand only when the phone is off the tailnet and OTA can't reach it — see
the CI budget section above.

### TestFlight delivery is verified via the ASC API, never a CI log line

A green `build` run means "uploaded", not "installable". Processing can still
fail silently afterwards. Confirm with App Store Connect:

```bash
python3 ~/.config/assistant/asc.py GET \
  "/v1/builds?filter[app]=<APP_ID>&limit=1&include=betaGroups&fields[builds]=version,processingState"
```

A build is delivered only when it has `betaGroups` containing `Internal` **and**
`internalBuildState = IN_BETA_TESTING`. Anything else — including
`PROCESSING`, `READY_FOR_BETA_SUBMISSION`, or an empty `betaGroups` — is not
delivered, and reporting it as delivered is a false PASS.

## Worked example: adding an Events tab

```bash
cd ~/coding/assistant/Overland-iOS
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/events -b events main
cd .claude/worktrees/events

scripts/new_module.sh Events
# → Modules/Events/EventsModule.{h,m}, Modules/Events/EventsViewController.{h,m}

# Build the real UI in EventsViewController.m. Import shared code by name:
#   #import "GLManager.h"        (location state)
#   #import "BakedConfig.h"      (GL_BAKED_HOST / GL_BAKED_TOKEN)
#   #import "GLEndpoints.h"      (GLEndpointURL(path) — build a full URL)
#   #import "GLDropUploader.h"   (POST helper)

# Append an Events screenshot step to .github/workflows/sim-test.yml
# (tab index 3) and bump the "installed 4 tabs" assertion.

git add -A && git commit -m "Add the Events micro app"
git push -u origin events
gh workflow run sim-test --ref events

# Poll, download main-screen artifact, LOOK at events-screen.png and
# main-screen.png (at the time Events was added the visible tab bar read
# Tracker | Settings | Upload | Events; today's current order is
# Journal | Todos | Events | Tracker, with Settings/Upload behind More).

git checkout main && git merge events && git push
# Watch `ota` go green (the only workflow the push triggers), then check the
# OTA page picked up the new build number.
```

Total files touched outside `Modules/Events/`: one — `sim-test.yml`. Two
sessions appending different screenshot steps to it conflict only on adjacent
lines; take both hunks.
